# colin-crying-detector

I'm running this code on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a cheap USB mic. You also need an account on pushover.net and the app on your smartphone. Then run something like:
```./bin/detect.py -a api-key -u user-key```

The code is very rough but works. I get a notification when my son is crying :)
